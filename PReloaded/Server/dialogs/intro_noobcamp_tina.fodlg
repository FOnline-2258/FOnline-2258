{2000}{}{[This woman is surprised to see that you just walked into her house!] Holy shit! What the hell do you want?!}
{2010}{}{Oh sorry! Wrong house!}
{2020}{}{[Stare at her for a bit, then wink with your best smile.]}
{2030}{}{I just walked by and saw this clean and tidy tent. I was wondering how can you keep it so clean in this messy place?}
{2040}{}{[Try to lift a deck of cards off the top shelf while keeping Tina busy] Can I get some water?}
{2050}{}{[Try to lift a deck of cards off the top shelf while keeping Tina busy] Can I get some water?}
{2060}{}{Are you Tina? I've come for the cards.}
{3000}{}{Get the hell out of here you creep!}

{4010}{}{Thanks!}
{5000}{}{Leave me alone already! Shoo! Shoo!}
{6000}{}{Oh.. thanks, I guess. It's not that hard anymore since I left Lawrence. That man was a pig! [She takes a deck of cards and throws them out of her tent, just like that.]}
{6010}{}{See ya around. [Pick up the cards outside]}
{7000}{}{[Tina turns halfway away to grab a bottle but then hesitates and snaps back to you.] You know what? There's a water pipe outside,  get your own water bag and fill it. Now get out!}
{7010}{}{Leave.}
{8000}{}{[Tina turns halfway away to grab a bottle and and start filling up a mug, giving you enough time to steal the cards.] Ah, you're the one solving the plague issue. Don't worry, I boiled the water before. There's a still nearby, you can distile water or brew even alcohol there! There you go.}
{8010}{}{Thank you. See ya.}
{100000001}{}{Better wash the counter again...}
{100000002}{}{That's 5 caps buddy. Hey did you hear me? Cough em' up.}

{100000007}{}{I swear if the next asshole doesn't tip. Ima' shoot somebody!}
{100000008}{}{I got bottles, I got shots, and I got a bat behind the counter for the retards. Your not a retard are you?}
{100000009}{}{Uh-huh, yeah that's nice buddy. You don't say...What? Of course I'm listening...}
{100000010}{}{That's 5 caps. FIVE CAPS Tribal! F.I.V.E! }
{100000011}{}{Shut up and order a fuckin' beer already!}
{100000012}{}{I swear if I have to serve another drunk, I'm getting the shotgun!}
{100000013}{}{Look the keg went dry, and it's going to be another month until the caravan shows up again.}
{100000014}{}{Really? You don't say, buy another drink or get out!}

{100000016}{}{Be right with ya'}
{100000017}{}{Have a sit stranger. I'll be with you in a moment.}

{100000019}{}{We're fresh outta' cold beer, sorry. You'll just have to drink it warm.}
{100000020}{}{RotGut? No man, go make that shit yourself! I wouldn't drink it!}

{100}{}{Алкоголик}
{200}{}{Вы видите пьяницу.}
{210}{}{Вы видите шатающегося из стороны в сторону пьяного человека в лохмотьях. Лицо его распухло, нос синющий как слива. А аромат рядом с ним такой, что свалит брамина насмерть. Он что-то бормочет про себя и иногда громко поет песни.}
{210}{}{Вы видите алкаша. Он весьма грязен - кажется, он повалялся в луже, но не особо этим расстроен.}

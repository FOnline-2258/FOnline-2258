{2000}{}{I am Sandro. What do you want?}
{2010}{}{Are you the one looking for some strange cards?}
{2020}{}{What do you do here?}
{2030}{}{Tell me about this place.}
{2040}{}{I want to trade.}
{2050}{}{I don�t want anything from you. Goodbye.}
{3000}{}{I am a gambling, drinking, and ... occasionally playing Tragic. }
{3010}{}{Tragic? What the hell are you talking about?}
{3020}{}{Right, let me ask you something else.}
{3030}{}{Gotta go, bye.}
{4000}{}{What do you want now?}
{4010}{}{Are you the one looking for some strange cards?}
{4020}{}{So, about the Tragic card deck we talked before...}
{4030}{}{I got some doubles, are you interested?}
{4040}{}{So, about the missing cards for your deck we talked before...}
{4050}{}{What do you do here?}
{4060}{}{Tell stories?}
{4070}{}{Tell stories?}
{4080}{}{I want to trade.}
{4090}{}{Tell me about this place.}
{4100}{}{I guess I don�t need anything right now. Goodbye.}
{5000}{}{Trade? I�m always ready to trade Tragic cards. I�ve got a couple of old Vox Mubies, a Black Dahlia, and some Rare Earths.}
{5010}{}{What the hell are you talking about?}
{5020}{}{Uh, I don�t know what you�re on, but I hope you have some in inventory to trade.}
{5030}{}{Hmm... let me ask you about something else, first.}
{5040}{}{I don�t need to trade right now. Goodbye.}
{6000}{}{Not much to tell, really. It's a trading town, but I'm here for the gambling. Not as dangerous for us ghouls as Reno or Redding.}
{6010}{}{Right, let me ask you something else.}
{6020}{}{Well, that describes a lot of people. Nothing new in that. I wanted to know something else.}
{7000}{}{Are you dumb? Tragic the Garnering is the most addictive thing since Jet. But I mostly play the simplified version. It's just to hard to find original players, most of the smoothskin can only handle the simplified version.}
{7010}{}{Tell me more about Tragic the Garnering again please.}
{7020}{}{Tell me more about this Tragic the Garnering.}
{7030}{}{Tell me about the simplified version.}
{7040}{}{What�s Jet?}
{7050}{}{I guess I�ll take your word for that. Goodbye.}
{8000}{}{Hmm, sorry. I only know a sad stories. By the way, have you seen an apple, lately?}
{8010}{}{An apple?}
{8020}{}{I�m too disappointed to talk right now. Goodbye.}
{9000}{}{I just love apples, but there aren�t many left anywhere. I hardly ever see them.}
{9010}{}{I didn�t know you were such a fruit fetishist. Tell me something else.}
{9020}{}{I�ve heard that you could really savor an apple because they were so slow to eat.}
{10000}{}{Slow?!? You are dumb. Fuck you! Apples are just as fast to eat as any other fruit. Apples rule. If it weren�t for a conspiracy on the part of fruit manufacturers we�d all have apples.}
{10010}{}{You�re crazed, aren�t you? I think you�ve been sampling too much of your own brew here. Tell me about something else.}
{10020}{}{Oh, yes... apples really are wonderful. (you back away slowly) Yes, that�s right. Good Sandro, easy there. Goodbye.}
{11000}{}{Well, as the saying goes, Tragic the Garnering isn�t just a game -- it�s an obsession. Not a cologne, either. Some think that the way it changes a person�s life is tragic, but they just don�t understand.}
{11010}{}{Uh huh.}
{11020}{}{Oh, THAT Tragic. Let me ask you something else, Sandro.}
{11030}{}{I can't see why anyone would think that. Goodbye.}
{12000}{}{Jet�s a drug that comes from New Reno. Were you born yesterday, or are you just dumb?}
{12010}{}{Oh, that Jet. Well, sure I knew about that. Tell me more about this Tragic the Garnering.}
{13000}{}{No, really. It�s wonderful. You should play. The only problem  besides getting someone intelligent enough to play with, was getting a proper deck. }
{13010}{}{Was?}
{13020}{}{I just say �No� to Tragic. Goodbye.}
{14000}{}{It's not an issue anymore. I started assembling new decks. Let me know if you are interested. }
{14010}{}{Sure, I would like a deck to try out the game.}
{14020}{}{I don�t think I really have time for that right now. Let me ask you something, though.}
{14030}{}{I tried it out already, thanks.}
{14040}{}{I�d love to stay and trade Tragic cards with you, but I�ve got things to do. You know, in real life? Goodbye.}
{15000}{}{First things first! I need you to collect a few cards from old worn decks. Currently I need a few cards to complement the new deck I want to make. Bring me one of each of these cards: @lex cards@ and we'll talk about that starting deck. I would also buy any doubles you have.}
{15010}{}{Right, here are the cards you asked for.}
{15020}{}{Do you know where I could find some of these cards?}
{15030}{}{I don't have those cards, let me ask you something else.}
{15040}{}{Maybe I�ll play later. Thanks for telling me how, though. Goodbye.}
{16000}{}{Wonderful. Let me give you your starting deck. Once you look at the cards, the game rules are self explanatory. It's called simplified for a reason. Good luck!}
{17000}{}{I won! Fuck you! You are dumb. I have crushed you. Now I can build an even better deck with your cards.}
{17010}{}{Uh, yeah. You won. Goodbye.}
{17020}{}{What a surprise. Well, at least I didn�t have to listen to one of your stories. Goodbye.}
{18000}{}{Maybe other Tragic players? I know of a group of ghouls who used to play around Bakersfield. Rumors have it that raiders and even Super Mutants tried it out, but I doubt it. Those muties got the higher end of the radioation deal on the physical side if you know what I mean, he, he...}
{18010}{}{Where is Bakersfield?}
{18020}{}{Where can I find those raiders?}
{18030}{}{Super Mutants?}
{18040}{}{Thanks. I got another question.}
{18050}{}{Thanks, I'll look into it.}
{19000}{}{It's called Necropolis nowadays and it's to the east from here. I'm sure some of us have these, but not sure if the others will trade with a smoothskin, so good luck.}
{19010}{}{Where can I find those raiders?}
{19020}{}{How about the Super Mutants?}
{19030}{}{Thanks. I got another question.}
{19040}{}{Thanks, I'll check there.}
{20000}{}{Raiders are everywhere. I heared Junktown has a problem with them that is the closest up north from here.}
{20010}{}{Where is Bakersfield?}
{20020}{}{How about the Super Mutants?}
{20030}{}{Thanks. I got another question.}
{20040}{}{Thanks, I'll check there.}
{21000}{}{You can find Super Mutants mostly around Broken Hills. That town welcomes every race, I heared that even the town sheriff leader is a Super Mutant.}
{21010}{}{Where is Bakersfield?}
{21020}{}{Where can I find those raiders?}
{21030}{}{Thanks. I got another question.}
{21040}{}{Thanks, I'll check there I'll be back soon.}
{22000}{}{You fell out of the stupid tree and hit every damn branch on the way down, didn�t you?@@Can't play Tragic with vegetation!@@ Cannot lobotomize this gem further!@@The simplified version is simple enough!@@No.. Card.. For.. Dum-dums!@@Tragic? You know what's tragic? Your mental capacity!@@Might as well teach a Radscorpion to play it!}
{23000}{}{...and if I play this card...@@No cards no game.@@Need apples.@@Mark loved this move.}
{24000}{}{...why Mark? ...why?@@Apples?@@..no..}
{25000}{}{Mark used to climb the skytower. This was his favourite card.}
{25010}{}{Who is Mark?}
{25020}{}{Skytower?}
{26000}{}{He left us.}
{26010}{}{What happened?}
{27000}{}{A fast fall with a sudden stop at the end.}
{27010}{}{Uh, oh. Can I ask you something else?}
{27020}{}{That's sad.}
{28000}{}{Yes. A high building to the north, inhabited by ex-military goons. Not the safest place to fool around.}
{28010}{}{Who is Mark?}
{29000}{}{Perfect. I can pay you my standard fee for a single card, but I tell you what, if you get me a bundle of three that really need right now, toss in some extra caps. Interested?}
{29010}{}{Sure. Which cards do you need this time?}
{29020}{}{Let's just trade cards I have right now.}
{29030}{}{Maybe next time. See ya.}
{30000}{}{At the moment I'm missing these cards to complete my deck: @lex cards@ Hurry up smoothskin, I'm playing Wooz next Sunday.}
{30010}{}{Right, here are the cards you asked for.}
{30020}{}{Do you know where I could find some of these cards?}
{30030}{}{What happens if you can't get them until Sunday?}
{30040}{}{Bye.}
{31000}{}{What do you think? I'll have to use another deck and drop this one! ...where are my apples...}
{32000}{}{Thansk for the cards.@@Take these caps.@@Allright,  Wooz about to be in for a surprise this time!}

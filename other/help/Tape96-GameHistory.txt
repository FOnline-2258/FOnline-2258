The original Fallout was released in 1997 and was an
immediate success. Fallout 2 was released only 1 year
later with the same results.

FOnline servers can all trace their roots back to the
original developer, A. Cvetinskiy "Cvet" who started
coding the game from scratch in early 2004 based on
reverse engineering from nma, teamx, cvet, atom, or
ghosthack, or from info from falloutmods wikia. This
was the first FOnline game called The Life After aka
TLA, an MMO in its 2nd Open Beta test in Nov 2008.

By late Dec 2008, Cvet agreed to let developers
called The Rotators start their own server and the
FOnline: 2238 project began.

A short season of closed beta testing began one month
later in Jan 2009 called Factions Mod, where players
teamed up via faction bases.

Open Beta 3 began on 15 Aug 2009, and became known as
FOnline: 2238, open so everyone could join and test
the game.

17 Aug 2009, the FOnline: 2238 Game Manual was
released.

18 Aug 2009, the game's official public board is
opened as an NMA subforum.

30 Aug 2009, the 1st server wipe switched to a brand
new database system and updated game content with
fixes and new features.

21 Nov 2009 sees a 2nd full wipe. It includes many
updates to enhance the economic system.

22 Dec 2009 sees FOnline: 2238's board moved to an
independant forum and the game gets its own wiki.

Sept 2010 is the 3rd full server wipe of 2238
and the start of its Season 5 which runs 1.5 years.

06 Jan 2012 is 2238's 4th full server wipe and
the start of Season 6.

The 2238 project ended prior to Aug 2013 and a few
servers subsequently began:

-Survivors: hosted by Spiritwind
-FOnline 2: hosted by skycast, wesan, rascal
-Reloaded: Kilgore, DocAn, mojuk, cubik2k, Mayck

Reloaded Season 1 had a strong following and lasted
13 months. It had an influx of new players in summer
2014 due to player advertising.

Season 2 started on 07 September 2014.

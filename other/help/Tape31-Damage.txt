EMP DAMAGE
Electromagnetic Pulse. Player characters are immune
to EMP damage which is however deadly to robots.
-Pulse Grenades

Each character has resistances to these known as DR
and DT.

DAMAGE THRESHOLD
DT represents a reduction of incoming damage that is
a number of incoming damage points rather than a
percentage of damage, and is calculated first before
DR. Certain perks like Toughness will increase DT as
well as certain armor. Drugs do not reduce DT. If a
character has a DT of 3 and is hit with a shotgun for
23, then 3 points of damage are removed immediately
so DR will be calculated on only 20 points of damage.

DAMAGE RESISTANCE
DR represents a reduction of incoming damage that is
a percentage of incoming damage rather than a number
of damage points, and is calculated after DT. Certain
perks like Toughness will increase DR and so will
certain armor, but also some drugs. If the character
above has DR of 10 from the perk Even Tougher, then
the 20 points of incoming damage gets reduced to 18.
If the same character uses standard Combat Armor, he
will have an additional 40 DR for a total of 50. That
orginal shotgun blast of 23 would be reduced to 10.
Drinking a beer will give 5 more DR which would bring
the net damage down to 9 from 23 in the above case.

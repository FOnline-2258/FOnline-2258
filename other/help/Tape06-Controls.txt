FOLLOW SOMEONE
Click-hold on a character to access the drag-down
menu and choose the fifth option, denoted as an arrow
pointing to a group. This adds an arrow over their
head. That character can leave via an exit grid and
you should get a prompt to follow them if you were
standing close enough to them when they left. The
character you tag to follow will see a chevron over
your head too which tells them you have them tagged
to follow. So look around in a crowd and see if
anyone has a chevron over their head - they tagged
you and might intend to follow you when you leave via
an exit grid.

FRIEND OR ENEMY
YOu can manually green or red someone by using other
options in the drag-down menu when you click-hold on
a character. There is no Buddy List.

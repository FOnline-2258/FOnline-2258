Info Tape 26: HOLOTAPES

*******************************************************

Information on Tape: Holotapes
The Miners, 27 July 2014

In-game data tapes are another unique feature. Tapes
can be used by any character to load info up to the
Pip-Boy for later reference. This is a very handy
way to keep certain info accessible in-game.

You can sometimes find blank holotapes for sale cheap
via NPC merchants. Single tapes are sold for 500 caps
at the Boneyard Library via dialogue. A few tapes
are also available via quests. They have pre-written
quest-related messages which can be erased so you can
re-use the tapes.

Holotapes are limited to <2000 characters max and 55
wide. Writing your own tape is best done in a txt
file out of game. The text can be copied from there
and pasted into a tape when a character's chat bar
is closed. Use your Science skill on a tape to open
the tape editing screen.

Hint: Keep line width to 53 characters 

LIMITS
The tape editing functions are very limited. It has
already been noted on the forum and devs have already
commented on this. Limits include the following:

-Erasing data is only done 1 character at a time.
-No way to delete a record once loaded to Pip-Boy.
-No way to scroll inside the editing screen.
-No way to re-organize list of records in Pip-Boy.
-Cannot use mouse pointer to orient editing cursor.

For these reasons, it is best to write longer tapes
out of game in a text file first and then paste into
a tape. If you attempt to paste too much data into a
tape, the paste process will fail, so use a character
counter tool when working with longer tapes.

Pasting data into a tape will also fail if the
character's chat bar is open.

Once loaded, the character can access the info by
opening his Pip-Boy and going to Archives.

One handy use for a holotape is to save a record of
your character's build. Write up the build details in
a text file, paste it into a blank tape and load it.
Now that character has his plan, perks, drugs, and
other notes available at a glance.

Now go have fun with holotapes!

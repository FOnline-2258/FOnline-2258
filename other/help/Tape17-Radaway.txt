Information on Tape: USING RADAWAY
The Miners, 04 Dec 2013

When you venture into radiated areas, especially high-
risk places like The Glow, you will need rad meds like
Rad-X and Radaway.

Rad-X is taken PRIOR to exposure to increase your
resistance to radiation. When you use a dose of Rad-X,
check your Rad Resistance. If it is less than 95%,
then you can take a 2nd dose, which should raise
your rad resistance to 95%. Rad-X is crucial to your
survival at highly radiated areas like The Glow, and
up to two doses can be taken to get the desired 95%
max resistance.

Radaway, however, is taken AFTER exposure. It reduces
your rad count by up to 150. Only one dose of Radaway
should be taken at a time, but multiple doses can be
taken if timed correctly as its effects are in three
stages. At Glow, you must take multiple concurrent
doses of Radaway in order to survive.

Upon taking a dose of Radaway, your rad count will be
reduced immediately by up to 25 rads. A few minutes
later, your rad count will drop a 2nd time, by up to
50 more. Wait longer and you will see the third and
final drop in rads by up to 75. In total, one dose of
Radaway is enough to reduce your rad count by 150.

But at places like The Glow, that won't be enough
because your rad count will go up too fast due to the
intensity of contamination. You will need to get
multiple doses of Radaway working simultaneously at
timed intervals. That means take one dose and wait,
then take another dose and repeat. If done correctly,
you might see a drop of 75 rads from your first dose
followed soon by a drop of 50 from your second dose.
Subsequent doses taken too soon will not be totally
wasted, and still reduce your rad count by up to 125.

You will experience ill effects of radiation even
with correct use of rad meds. Extreme nausea and
vomitting will occur. Do not panic. Stay calm, use
Radaway regularly, and take instruction from the
group as needed.

So bring plenty of rad meds whenever you travel!

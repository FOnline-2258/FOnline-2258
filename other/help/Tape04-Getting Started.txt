Information on Tape: GETTING STARTED
The Miners, 21 Dec 2013

When starting a new character, one of the best things
any player can do is plan each build carefully, using
one of the planner tools. But if you already made a
character and are too eager to start exploring and
don't want to do any reading first, there are various
approaches to your initial survival.

You'll want to get some gear and start hunting in the
wasteland right away but first consider that your gun
skill is too low at level 1 to hit anything. With gun
skills under 100, you'll suffer more critical fails
and break weapons. So at level 1, consider doing some
non-combat tasks first, to get some xp. You'll have
some Skill Points then to boost your combat skill over
100 and probably some caps too.

JOBS AND QUESTS
There are some easy things to do to get some initial
xp, caps, and some basic tools. You can shovel poo,
move boxes, water the Hub farmers, uncover the four
train stations, deliver messages, etc. At level 2,
watch the map near Hub for the Wasteland Tent quest
to get your first tent.

TENTS
Each character can have 10 tents and the location of
each tent can be shared with multiple characters. Use
3 wood on a firepit to upgrade it to Campfire. Rename
the tent and create a map. With Outdoorsman skill up
to 100, get the Ranger perk so your additional tents
are Safe Houses which have a workbench.

CRAFTING
Gather resources and craft items to get easy xp. Find
junk, flint, broc, xander, and mine iron and minerals
to make metal parts and gunpowder. You can buy skill
books at the Hub Bookstore to increase your Repair
and Science skills to make better gear. Gather junk
and sell it at Salvagers in Boneyard for quick caps
to pay for books and professional training.

HUNTING
When you're ready, hunt some easy critters to get more
xp, perks, level up and get higher skills. Use TB mode
to minimize failures, but it's slower. Use RT mode to
go faster, but it's riskier.

There is so much more to know...

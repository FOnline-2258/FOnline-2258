The Miners, 10 Aug 2014

The crafting system is a major feature not only so
wastelanders can supply themselves with the best gear
for combat, but to stimulate the economy as well. The
Fix-Boy opens when you press F. There you will see a
list of items you can craft along with recipes. Some
items require blueprints and some require specific
things like a Medical Terminal or a Repair Tool or an
Advanced Workbench.

MEDICAL TERMINALS
-Inside Vault City's vault
-Inside Vault 15
-Shi Temple in San Fran
-In Vault 12 under Necropolis

ADVANCED WORKBENCHES
-Gunrunners
-All Town Control towns
-Klamath Toxic Caves
-Mariposa Military Base

BLUEPRINTS
Your Fix-Boy's list of craftable items gets longer
as you aquire profesional training and longer still
as you get blueprints to make the best gear of all.

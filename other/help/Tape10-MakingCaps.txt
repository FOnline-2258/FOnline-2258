Information on Tape: MAKING CAPS
The Miners, 09 Aug 2014

Everyone needs caps to buy certain things like cars
and bases plus whatever gear or drugs they do not
wish to craft. Here are some of the more popular ways
to make caps:

CRAFTING
Making ammo and selling it to NPC merchants is the
most common way to make fast caps. Get Barter skill
up higher to get a slight advantage. Anyone can mine
and craft some basic gear even with no professions.
Get a level of gunsmith training though and you will
be able to make more variety of ammo and guns too.
All crafted items can then be sold to NPCs or even
to other player characters. Use the Barter Grounds
location for safer trades with players. Drugs in
particular can be a major source of caps for those
willing to craft them, as Reloaded is heavily
oriented toward PvP combat. Buffout, Psycho, Jet,
and Super Stims are highly coveted.

LOCKER HUNTING
You can find locked footlockers in random encounters
in zones with city ruins and open them with decent
Lockpick skill. This is one way to get caps directly
along with many other items that can be sold. Get the
Treasure Hunter perk to get more caps this way.

FARMING
Go out leveling and loot your enemies for items. Sell
it or dismantle it for resources. Get the Dismantler
perk for best results.

PRIVATE MINES
Private mines are a time-effective way to get large
quantities of mineable resources without having to
actually do the work yourself. You get a few slaves
stationed inside and get them working. Come back in
a week and they will be loaded with nuggets including
some HQ. Check for developer updates.

SELL JUNK
NPC merchants have caps limits but you can sell junk
at Salvagers in Boneyard anytime. Junk is heavy and
it takes longer to gather but at least it is an
option when there are no other caps to be found.

SELL SPEARS
You can also sell spears at Junktown anytime. It's
another last choice but it works.

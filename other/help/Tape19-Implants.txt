Info Tape 19: COMBAT IMPLANTS

*******************************************************

Information on Tape: COMBAT IMPLANTS
The Miners, 25 Dec 2013

Any character can get surgical procedures to enhance
combat performance. What is required are Implant
Modules, a fresh Combat Armor, and 100k caps per
procedure to pay for the service, which is available
in San Francisco from Dr Fung.

The basic implants can be surgically installed in a
character that is level 30 or higher. They include:

Dermal Impact Armor       +4% DR Normal/Explode
Phoenix Armor Implants   +4% DR Fire/Laser/Plasma
Nemean Armor (1)            +20 Max Hit Points
Hypertrophy Accelerator +1 Strength
Optics Enhancer              +1 Perception
Nociception Regulator     +1 Endurance
Empathy Synthesizer       +1 Charisma
Logic Co-Processor         +1 Intelligence
Reflex Booster               +1 Agility
Probability Calculator     +1 Luck

The advanced implants require minimum level 40. The
Dermal and Phoenix implants will not only boost
Damage Resistance but also Damage Threshold:

Dermal Impact Assault Enhancement
 4% DR and +1 DT Normal/Explode

Phoenix Assault Enhancement
 4% DR and +1 DT Fire/Laser/Plasma

Nemean Armor (2) +20 Max Hit Points

Only one module can be implanted per procedure. Any
single character can potentially get all implants
installed if planned correctly. This surgery is a
permanent modification of the character and cannot
be undone or moved.

Implants are a new feature of this server and are hard
to get until the new dungeons are implemented, at
which time they will probably still be challenging
to obtain. Check the game forum and recent Changelogs
for news about how to obtain implants.

The availability of implants will have an impact on
how certain character builds are planned. Implants
will be highly coveted for that reason, so that PvP
fighters can be further optimized. If you obtain an
implant, before you eagerly run your crafter off to
get surgery, consider using it only on a carefully
planned fighter build, designed with implants in mind.

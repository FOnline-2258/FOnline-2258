Information on Tape: VEHICLE LIST
The Miners, 09 Aug 2014

Trunks can be re-locked using crafted Locks. Car keys
each have unique ID numbers that match the car's key
number. Fuel Cell Controllers (FCC) can be found in
a certain wrecked car in random encounters, but are
rare. The wreck is a hoodless convertible with a
visible engine and will sometimes only yield junk and
maybe a common epart.

Check the time in your Pip-Boy and ask ticket-taker
for train schedule. The four train stations are
available after doing any one of three quests.

Info Tape 51: PRE-TC CHECKLIST

*******************************************************

Information on Tape: PRE-TC CHECKLIST
The Miners, 03 August 2014

Being an effective team means each teammate takes
PvP seriously. Make sure you have covered these items
so your team will have a professional start.

VOICE CHAT
Mandatory. PvP is too fast for text chat.

BUILD VERIFICATION
You need a true PvP build. Do not bring anything less
to PvP. Get the help you need planning an optimal
build. Use a planner tool for best results and use
the VTDB feature to share a build for feedback.

NAME COLORIZING
Manually marking others as friends or enemies is not
good enough for team ops. Instead, use a custom
NameColorizing txt file. Rename your default file and
get the team's custom version. That way all enemies
will automatically show up red for all teammates.

KEY BINDINGS
Each player is expected to set up hotkeys to do fast
reloads and Superstims.

FIELD OF VIEW
Enable your Sight/weapon range indicators: Q and W.

SAFE PLACES
Each member is expected to have places already set up
next to PvP locations for spare gear.

TRANSPORTATION
Each fighter is expected to have a car and move fast
on the map. Outdoorsman 150 with Pathfinder and
Explorer perks allow a fighter to return to the fight
quickly on foot. Your team needs you back in the
fight asap!

SPARE GEAR
Each fighter is expected to have plenty of spare gear
ready to go. This includes:
- Armor
- Weapons
- Ammo
- Combat Drugs
- SStims

FOLLOW THE LEADER
- Pay attention to the leader and follow orders.
- All members shoot at same target. Focus fire!
- Avoid meat shields in Power Armor. Shoot them last.
- Control your impetuous tendancies. Don't go Rambo.
- Move together as a group to stay strong.

BASICS
- Practice. Hinkley helps.
- Shoot and take cover to recharge your AP.
- Watch out for sneakers and anyone trying to 1-hex.
- Stay cool. We all lose gear. It's just pixels.
- Do not Fast-Relog to an alternate fighter.
- Do not insult the enemy. Have some class.

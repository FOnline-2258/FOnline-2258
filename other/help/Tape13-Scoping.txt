Info Tape 13: TOWN SCOPING

*******************************************************

Information on Tape: SCOPING TOWNS
The Miners, 20 Dec 2013

When you arrive at a major location, you should spy it
first before entering. Other players may be present in
that area and you can take a peek to see who is there
before you enter.

Not all map locations have this option, but cities do
and several other places on the world map do as well.
To scope one out, go there on the map but when you get
to it, don't click on it to enter it yet. Instead,
stay on the world map and click on the Town/World
button. This will toggle your map view from the world
map to a local town map, which will show you the
major areas of that location including alternate
entry points.

Each entry point has an up-down arrow on the town map.
If you click the down-arrow, you will enter that place
immediately, but click the up-arrow to spy on that
area first, without going in yet. What you see is a
snapshot of that area at that moment. From there, you
can choose to enter immediately or go Back to the 
local map and spy the other entry points if there are
any. What you see when scoping is not 100% reliable
so if you suspect danger, scope it a few times before
entering. Do you see other players there? Do you see
any sign of conflict? Any dead NPCs or gear laying
around?

This scoping feature is especially helpful when going
to notoriously risky areas like the northern towns and
New Reno. The northern towns are part of the Town
Control system so they are often PvP intense. Reno
has many areas that can be scoped before you enter,
such as the Garage where players buy cars. Be advised
that PKs will scope areas too, waiting to find someone
entering so they can enter and attack. So if for
example you're going to buy a car from T-Ray, scoping
the Garage first is a very good idea.

It's a harsh wasteland so features like this become
important for your survival. Use the Town/World
options frequently whenever you arrive at a major
location on the map. Be careful and don't give up!

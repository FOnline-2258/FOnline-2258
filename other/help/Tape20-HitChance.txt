Info Tape 20: CHANCE TO HIT

Information on Tape: CHANCE TO HIT
The Miners, 08 Jan 2014

It is very important to understand the factors that
affect your success in battle, and one primary factor
is Hit Chance.

It is likely that Hit Chance is always between 5-95%
so even the most skilled marksman will miss a target
once every 20 shots on average.

Many things affect Hit Chance. It can be calculated
according to the items below. These are not listed
in formula order:

* Start with Weapon Skill, which can be maxed at 300.

* Deduct 4% for each hex between you and the target.

* Each weapon has a minimum Strength requirement. You
can use weapons even if your ST is lower, but you will
suffer a Hit Chance penalty of 20% for each missing ST
point.

* Add a bonus based on Perception. It is (PE-2)x8 by
default, but is (PE-2)x16 for any weapon with the
Long Range weapon perk, or (PE-2)x20 for the
Scoped Hunting Rifle.

* Add another 20% bonus when using any weapon with
the Accurate weapon perk.

* Characters with the Sharpshooter perk benefit from
another 8% bonus to Hit Chance.

* Darkness should cause a penalty to Hit Chance,
though this is possibly not implemented yet.

* Obstructions in the line of fire can cause a penalty
to your Hit Chance. This includes other potential
targets whether friendly or hostile.

* Add a 32% bonus to Hit Chance when using a weapon
with the Scoped weapon perk at 8 or more hexes from
the target.

* Subtract 5% from Hit Chance when using a weapon
with the Scoped weapon perk at 7 hexes are closer to
the target.

* Subtract a penalty to Hit Chance when doing an AIMED
attack, based on the targeted area regardless of Luck.
Eyes: -60, Head: -40, Groin: -30, Arms: -30, Legs: -20
No penalty to AIMED shots at torso.

* When shooting at a running target, first subtract
your ammo's AC modifier from your target's Armor
Class, and then subtract the result as a penalty to
your Hit Chance.

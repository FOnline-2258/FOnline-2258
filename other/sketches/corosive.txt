Journal of the Officer

2250. April. 22:34. Officer logging daily duties then signing out. Stop. Personal log. Cira’s birthday is tomorrow. Stop. Please remind me never to forget about her again. My mind has been wandering off more than usual, and I am always cold.

2250. April. 12:54. The air is getting stale. Overseer requested new filters installed on the vents. However, for some reason we are running low. Robobrain, and Thomas will have to improvise in the near future. We are not prepared for shortage. It is odd, how our resources keep dwindling. Stop. Officer logging daily duties. Overseer, is our vault dying?

2251. January. 06:00. I’m having nightmares, and I can barely breath. Thomas says it’s the dust in the air, but I don’t know if that’s a good enough answer. Is my home dying? I can’t remember the last time I was really happy. I haven’t had a decent meal in weeks, and I completely forgot Cira’s birthday again. We haven’t spoken in a few days either. Officer logging daily duties. Personal log. What is out there?

2251. March. 14:45. Thomas is dead. The Overseer had me shoot him until he was dead. I fear that if this goes on I won't have any friends left. What is going on down here? How long can we keep this place up? Officer logging daily duties. Personal log. I miss you, Thomas.

2252. March. 04:40. Logging computal security breach. This morning our systems were affected by some sort of glitch. A list of passwords and logins were suddenly sent off to the surface... Somewhere. The mainframe was unable to trace the recipient, but it was sent to the United States. Impossible. Unless there is life on the surface...

2252. March. 23:09. Logging possible surface hazard. After midnight there was a loud banging sound coming from the other end of the surface doors. Security was unable to determine the cause of the disturbance. If there is life out there will it be friendly?

2253. September. 00:04. Logging status update. Vault future facing catastrophic eventual destruction. Resources and materials are depleting at an alarming rate. Vault is unable to sustain daily agriculture or food production. Highly recommend begin exploring surface.

2254. January. 00:00. Doomsday. Our vault doors opened on their own today at exactly midnight. It is the same day that our resources completely ran out, and most of our equipment stopped working. All this of course is supposed to be impossible! Our systems were meant to last forever! We had a completely self-sustaining system here! Nothing was supposed to go wrong! And now they're sending us out in droves!! The Overseer is sending me out next! In less than a few hours I’ll be cast out of my vault, and thrown into the god forsaken wasteland! Officer signing out.

This will be my last entry. God help us all. Cira! I'm so sorry! I've always been a horrible friend! I'm so sorry! Please God! Be good to her! Please! She's so innocent! She doesn't deserve to be thrown out to the wolves!
